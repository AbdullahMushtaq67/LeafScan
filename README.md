## Model Architecture

This project uses **MobileNetV2** as a backbone (pretrained on ImageNet) with a small custom head for classification. Only the head is trained on **PlantVillage dataset**, making training fast and deployment lightweight.

### Model Specs

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Architecture | MobileNetV2 backbone + custom head |
| Base Parameters | ~3.5 M (frozen) |
| Total Parameters | ~3.7 M (trainable head only) |
| Model Size | ~14 MB |
| Input Shape | 224 × 224 × 3 (RGB) |
| Optimizer | Adam |
| Loss | Categorical Crossentropy |
| Activation | ReLU (hidden), Softmax (output) |

**Why MobileNetV2?**

- Lightweight, fast, and mobile-friendly  
- Pretrained weights help with faster and more accurate training  
- Freezing base reduces memory and speeds up training

## 💻 Usage

### **Option 1: Use Pre-trained Model (Recommended)** ⚡

**No training required!** The pre-trained model is already included.

```bash
# Navigate to app directory
cd app

# Run the Streamlit application
streamlit run main.py
```

The app will open in your browser at: **`http://localhost:8501`**

### **Step-by-Step Usage**

1. **Upload an Image**: Click "Upload a leaf image..." and select a plant leaf photo
2. **Click Classify**: Press the "🔍 Classify Disease" button
3. **View Results**: See the prediction, confidence score, and treatment recommendations
4. **Test with Sample Images**: Use images from the `test_images/` folder

### **Option 2: Train Your Own Model** 🏋️

If you want to retrain with custom data:

```bash
# 1. Download the dataset 
# Option A: Manual download
# Download from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karagwaanntreasure/plant-disease-detection
# Extract to: project/Dataset/

# Option B: Using Kaggle API
# Place kaggle.json in app/ folder
# Run the Jupyter notebook

# 2. Open Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook model_training_notebook/Plant_Disease_Prediction_CNN_Image_Classifier.ipynb

# 3. Run all cells to train the model
# Training time: ~161 minutes on CPU, ~15-30 minutes on GPU

# 4. Model will be saved to: app/trained_model/plant_disease_prediction_model.h5
```
